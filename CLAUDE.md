## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- Do not add build verification steps to the plan. I will ask you to generate code after you have given me the plan, and I will verify the code myself.
